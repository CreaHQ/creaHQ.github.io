Culture - Making changes by changing how things are made

Welcome to Parkside
A place that is alive and changes constantly, with all those in it. A space for play and reflection, for discovery and growth, for movement and letting it all be still for a moment.

It’s where ideas are found and put into action. It takes curiosity, collaboration and a line of code or two. It’s discovery, design & development — all working together to create interactive experiences that people love to use.

From our beginnings…
The years since 2005 have been an incredible journey for us — what started out small has turned into something bigger and we can’t wait to see what’s next. So this seems like the perfect moment for us to stop, take a look back and show you who we are today.

To the present…
From an office that was way too big for just four to one with more than 70 employees that is currently being expanded just because we need the space.
From our first clients to the big bang in the United States. From technologies that belong to the past to those that will determine our future.

We create interactive experiences that people love to use.
It’s at the intersection of what the world needs, what improves our industry and what’s special about us. Our purpose going forward is based on this, as are all our values & ideas.

— CEO
