Our city â€” has more than potential

Located in the heart of Europe, Graz is the perfect spot for working and exploring Europe at the same time. Go for a hike in the impressive Austrian alps or enjoy a swim in crystal clear lakes. Reach exciting cities and countries like Vienna, Budapest, Italy and Croatia within hours. All of which makes Austria a country with an incredibly high standard of living.

As the UNESCO City of Design, Graz has a deep rooted design culture reflected in annual design competitions, large scale design projects realized and the collective of creative individuals found here.
